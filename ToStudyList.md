# Post-Graduation Study List

Your education doesn't stop after graduation. In truth, your NSS experience is only the very beginning. By entering the field of software development you've committed yourself to a career of regular learning. (Some people would say "constant learning", but _constant_ is maybe a bit much..._regular_ is plenty)

These are some items you may want to explore after graduation. You are **strongly** encouraged to make your own list based on your personal preferences and interests, and the kind of job you're seeking. Remember it's much easier to learn things you find interesting, so if something on this list doesn't interest you, it's ok to skip it for now. There will always be plenty to learn. You're sure to find something that grabs your attention.
