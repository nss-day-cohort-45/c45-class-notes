# LINQ vs Loops

This program is a series of comparisons of Linq methods vs equivalent code done with traditional loops.

## Notes

Linq

* Language Integrated Query
  * A set of methods on collections that let us query and manipulate collections
  * Often a more concise approach to working with collection than loops
  * In order to use linq, you have to use a  `using System.Linq;` statement
  * Linq methods are very similar to javascript array methods
    * that (very) different names
    * same goals though
  * Name of many linq methods are inspired by SQL
  * Linq doesn't completely replace loops
  * Understanding loops and if statements is ESSENTIAL to understanding linq
  * Understanding linq will be useful when it comes time to interview for job
  * Two syntaxes for Linq
    * Method Syntax
      * This is just calling methods like you'd expect
    * Query Syntax
      * this is designed to look more like SQL

The code in the project should serve as an introduction to Linq. When you're ready to go further, these resources will help.
